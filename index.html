  <h1>Welcome to</h1>
  <h2>Joshua <br> Plagerman's</h2>
  <h3>Portfolio</h3>
  <p>Joshua Plagerman is a Senior Graphic/UX Designer at Eastern Washington University. He have always loved the problem solving aspect of the UX world and mended it together with my love for art and design. Joshua is always looking at the world through a critical eye, pointing out flaws or ways things can change or tweaked for the everyday person. When he is not being a critic, Josh usually spend his time on his guitar, improvising rifts or trying to be like some of his favorite artists. Josh is a hardworking, passionate, dedicated and very self motivated person, always trying to be the best possible version of himself. He has had many years of experience designing yearbooks, their pages and layouts aswell as covers for books. He also loves designing interfaces for web pages and apps, using many different platforms to get the job done. In the future, Joshua plans on combining his passion for music and art into a job that appeases both aspects. </p>
